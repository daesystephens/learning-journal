2. jQuery is a simpler way to perform common tasks.
3. jQuery has cross-browser compatibility.

## Where to Place your Script
The position of <script> elements can affect how quickly a web page seems to load.
Placing the script at the end of the page before the closing </body> tag, it won't affect the rendering of the rest of the page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Title of the document</title>
    </head>

    <body>
      The content of the document......
      <script src="js/sample.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Pair Programing
* Takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code.
* The experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
* The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developerâ€™s knowledge and guidance.
* It is great for improving social skills.
