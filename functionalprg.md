# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript has the most important features needed for functional programming

1. First class functions: using functions as data values, pass functions as arguments also called CALLBACKS, 

2. Anonymous functions and concise lambda syntax: x => x * 2 is a valid function expression in JavaScript. 
Is a function that works right on the spot and sometimes doesn't require parameters.

3. Closures: Closures are how functions get their fixed arguments. Is when they have access to his local variable or a global variable to perform an action

4. Mutation: Objects need to be mutable in order for their data to be updated

```javascript
const barDrinkMenu = {
  drink: 'tequila'
};
barDrinkMenu.drink = 'pina colada'; // mutation
```
