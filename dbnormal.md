# Database Normalization

**There are 3 reasons to normalize data**

1. minimize duplicate data
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. simplify queries

**Problems Without Normalization**
- Extra and useless use of memory space
- Difficulty to handle and update data

**Normalization Rule**
Normalization rules are divided into the following normal forms:

1. First Normal Form
Data is stored in tables with rows uniquely identified by a primary key

2. Second Normal Form
Only data that relates to a tableâ€™s primary key is stored in each table

3. Third Normal Form
There are no in-table dependencies between the columns in each table
