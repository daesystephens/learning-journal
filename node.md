# NODE.JS
Is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of a browser.

**Node** is also used to build back-end services like API Application Programming Interface.

**Node** is ideal for building highly-scalable, data-intensive, and real-time apps.

The creators of NodeJS took JavaScript which is usually confined to a browser (front-end) and they allowed to run into your computer (back-end). Previous to NodeJS JavaScript was exclusively a front-end language, thanks to NodeJS now you don't need to learn another language to be a full-stack developer.

**With NodeJS**
- you can listen network traffic on your machine 
- you can listen to HTTP requests
- you can access databases directly
